<h4>The 2018 ISB Intern Interactions Project</h4> <br>

<h5><strong>Welcome!</strong></h5>

    Thank you for taking time to help out with our project. The idea is simple; your interaction data will used to model the social network that is created by the interns at the ISB. The interactive network model (seen in Your Existing Network ~ available soon) will temporally track interactions for five cateogories; Administrative, Programming, Data, Biology and Social. If you choose to log an interaction with "Intern Group", the type of interaction can remain an Administrative one.<br><br>

    The goal of this project is to develop a method in which work place interactions can be voluntarily logged and modeled. The larger goal will be to learn from the interactions that are taking place in order to learn about the culture and social dynamics that the interns are both subject to and influence. Three surveys will be handed out over the course of the Summer that will ask a variety of questions about your satisfaction at the ISB. These will be used to determine if there are any correlates with the interaction data. <br><br>

In order for this to work, we're going to need quite a bit of data. Our target is to model <strong>1200</strong> interactions by the end of the Summer and if we can get there, a pizza party (or any other kind of party) will be waiting for all the interns! <strong>If each person logs just two interactions a day (ten interactions per week)</strong>, we should be able to hit our goal!<br><br>


Thank you for participating and be sure to look out for updates that will roll out over the next few weeks -- inlcuding privacy setting and interactive networks and tables!<br><br><br>
