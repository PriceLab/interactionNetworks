<h4>The 2018 ISB Intern Interactions Project</h4> <br>

<h5><strong>Welcome!</strong></h5>

Thank you for taking time to help out with our project. The idea is simple; your interaction data will used to model the social network that is created by the people at the ISB. In order for this to work, we're going to need quite a bit of data. Our target is to model <strong>1200</strong> interactions by the end of the Summer and if we can get there, a pizza party (or any other kind of party) will be waiting for all the interns! <strong>If each person logs just two interactions a day (ten interactions per week)</strong>, we should be able to hit our goal!<br><br>


Thank you for participating and be sure to look out for updates that will roll out over the next few weeks!<br><br><br>

<strong>Interaction Count Update:</strong> 612/1200<br><br><br>
